# IOMessage
Messaging app with vanilla JavaScript, Socket.io and MongoDB for message history.
There is also a Jasmine testing package for automated testing. 

This is the product of a LinkedIn-learning course that I took in August 2023. 
Quite simple app.

To run it: 
Clone or fork the files. 
In the terminal run npm install to install the dependencies. 
Run nodemon from your terminal. 
Open your browser and navigate to localhost:3000
Enjoy.
